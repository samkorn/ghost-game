Notable changes to the `ghost` repository, beginning with version 1.1.0, will be documented in this file.

*This repository adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (SemVer) standards. A branch is considered 'released' when it is merged into either the development or master branch. The development branch indicator, 'b', is left out of version numbering in the change log, as all versions with the same ternary version number should be identical between the development and master branches.*
